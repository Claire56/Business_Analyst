You can google how to use numpy shuffle. **Note that, since you shuffled the list, you have to use logical indexing to access the correct class grades**\n",

For example row 7 in the matrix grades will represent the grades of the five subjects in order, after shuffling the classes names, for the student who has ID 8. In other words, grades[49,3] will return the grade of the class with index of 3 for the student who has ID 50\n",
